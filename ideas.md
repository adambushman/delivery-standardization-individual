1.  We must stress "business value". In our presentation, we need to use language like "by doing X, Swire will save Y". Here's some examples:
    *   "By moving x,y,z to white truck, we believe Swire will lose out on just ### cases/gallons of business"
    *   "By moving x,y,z to white truck, we believe Swire will save ### on delivery expenses"


2.  We implement some clustering to find natural groups. We can do this among the "franchises" vs "solos". This will essentially create "profiles"; each profile may have different rules for white truck assignment.


3.  We can look to use some causal inference to assess the impact of an intervention (move to white truck).


4.  We can experiment with forecasting future sales among the above profiles.
